                    Education has a vital role to play in moulding, shaping, sharpening and directing an individual, the society and the nation towards the attainment of the described goals. Tomorrowâ€™s society will be guided by the kind of education we provide to the students today. The educational institutions must act upon the challenges of the time and prepare the citizens for a satisfying future. Bearing this philosophy in mind, REHDON was incepted in 2000 to provide quality education.
